# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 21, 2024 
##### Financial Analysis with Python 

The purpose of the task is to explore a variety of Python libraries - Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, in handling stock market data, visualizing trends, and assisting in the construction of trading strategies. Possible applications
* fetch historical data to backtest investment strategy
* under the financial market's dynamics

**Today's Progress**: Survey the land of opportunities. Learn to do
1. import data from yfinance using pandas_datareader
2. work with Time Series Data
3. visualize the trend using matplotlib

**Thoughts:** 
Using Python for financial data analysis is my interest.

### Day 2: February 22, 2024

##### Get started "Understanding Deep Learning"

Get started with the 68 Python notebooks that accompany book Understanding Deep Learning to be published by MIT Press on December 5th. Each illustrates an idea from the book -- they have skeleton code with some missing parts for you to fill in. If you are learning (or teaching) deep learning, they will REALLY help.

Book draft and notebooks available at: http://udlbook.com

The notebooks so far cover supervised learning, shallow and deep networks, losses, training, initialization, regularization, measuring performance, convolutional networks, residual connections, batch normalization, transformers and graph neural networks. Working on the remaining ones (mostly generative models and reinforcement learning) right now.

P.s. One of them Rickrolls you... you'll have to work through them all to find which.

### Pomodoro Timer
Investigate Python framework and example to create a Pomodoro Timer

### Day 5: March 1, 2024

### PomoTimer with PyQt6

üöÄ **Project Update - PomoTimer v0.1**

Just wrapped up an intense coding session! In the past 2.5 hours, I dived into PyQt6 and crafted a basic clock. Exciting stuff! But then, I decided to level up and spent the next hour collaborating with ChatGPT to reimagine and simplify my PomoTimer (Pomodoro Timer).

**PomoTimer v0.1 Features:**
1. üï∞Ô∏è Large digit display for 25 minutes.
2. üîÑ Dynamic button:
   - Displays "Start" before the timer countdown.
   - Switches to "Reset" during the timer completes.

Check out the first version [PomoTimer Timer_UI](https://github.com/ylgatatooine/100-days-of-code/blob/master/src/PomoTimer/timer_ui.py)

Stay tuned for more updates as we refine and expand the functionality! üî•
