##### Financial Analysis with Python 

The purpose of the task is to explore a variety of Python libraries - Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, in handling stock market data, visualizing trends, and assisting in the construction of trading strategies. Possible applications
* fetch historical data to backtest investment strategy
* under the financial market's dynamics

**Today's Progress**: Survey the land of opportunities. Learn to do
1. import data from yfinance using pandas_datareader
2. work with Time Series Data
3. visualize the trend using matplotlib

**Thoughts:** 
Using Python for financial data analysis is my interest.

### Day 2: February 22, 2024

##### Get started "Understanding Deep Learning"

Get started with the 68 Python notebooks that accompany book Understanding Deep Learning to be published by MIT Press on December 5th. Each illustrates an idea from the book -- they have skeleton code with some missing parts for you to fill in. If you are learning (or teaching) deep learning, they will REALLY help.

Book draft and notebooks available at: http://udlbook.com

The notebooks so far cover supervised learning, shallow and deep networks, losses, training, initialization, regularization, measuring performance, convolutional networks, residual connections, batch normalization, transformers and graph neural networks. Working on the remaining ones (mostly generative models and reinforcement learning) right now.

P.s. One of them Rickrolls you... you'll have to work through them all to find which.
