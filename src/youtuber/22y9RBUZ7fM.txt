i found that nothing in life
is worthwhile
unless you take risks
nothing
nelson mandela said there is no passion
to be found
playing small
in settling for a life that's less
than the one you're capable of living
now i'm sure in your experiences in
school and applying to college and
picking your major and deciding what you
want to do with life i'm sure people
have told you to make sure you have
something to fall back on make sure you
got something to fall back on honey
but i never understood that concept
having something to fall back on
if i'm going to fall
i don't want to fall back on anything
except my faith
i want to fall forward
i figure at least this way i'll see what
i'm going to hit
every failed experiment is one step
closer to success you've got to take
risks and i'm sure you've probably heard
that before but i want to talk to you
about why that's so important
i got three reasons and then you can
pick up your iphones
first
you will fail at some point in your life
accept it you will lose you will
embarrass yourself you will suck at
something there's no doubt about it
and i know that's probably not a
traditional message for a graduation
ceremony but hey
i'm telling you embrace it because it's
inevitable
and i should know
in the acting business you fail all the
time early on in my career
i auditioned for a part in a broadway
musical
perfect role for me i thought
except for the fact that i can't sing
i didn't get the job
but here's the thing
[Music]
i didn't quit
i didn't fall back
i walked out of there to prepare for the
next audition and the next audition and
the next audition
i prayed
i prayed
and i prayed
but i continued to fail
and fail
and fail but it didn't matter because
you know what
there's an old saying
you hang around the barber shop long
enough sooner or later you're going to
get a haircut
so you will catch a break and i did
catch a break
last year i did a play called fences on
broadway
that's how someone talked about it
won the tony award
[Music]
and i didn't have to sing by the way
but here's the kicker
it was at the court theater
it was at the same theater that i failed
that first audition
30 years prior
[Music]
the point is
and i'll pick up the pace
the point is every graduate here today
has the training and the talent to
succeed
but do you have the guts
to fail
here's my second point about failure if
you don't fail
you're not even trying
i'll say it again if you don't fail
you're not even trying my wife told me
this great expression to get something
you never had you have to do something
you never did
les brown's a motivational speaker he
made an analogy about this he says
imagine you're on your death bed and
standing around your death bed are the
ghosts representing your unfulfilled
potential the ghost of the ideas you
never acted on the ghost of the talents
you didn't use and they're standing
around your bed angry disappointed and
upset
they say we came to you because you
could have brought us to life they say
and now we have to go to the grave
together so i ask you today
how many ghosts are going to be around
your bed when your time comes
all right now here's my last point about
failure
sometimes
it's the best way
to figure out where you're going
[Music]
your life will never be a straight path
i began at fordham university as a
pre-med student i i i i took a course
called the
cardiac morph i still can't say it
cardiac
cardiac morphogenesis i couldn't read it
i couldn't say it i sure couldn't pass
it
so then i decided to go into pre-law
then journalism and with no academic
focus my grades took off in their own
direction
yeah down
i was a 1.8 gpa
[Music]
one semester and the university very
politely suggested that it might be
better to take some time off
i was 20 years old i was at my lowest
point
and then one day and i remember the
exact day march 27 1975 i was helping my
mother in her beauty shop my mother
owned a beauty shop up in mount vernon
and there's there was this older woman
who was uh considered one of the elders
in the town and i didn't know her
personally but i i was looking in the
mirror and every time i looked in the
mirror i could see her behind me and she
was staring at me
she just kept looking at me every time i
looked at it she kept giving me these
strange looks
so she finally took the dryer off her
head and said to some she said something
i'll never forget
first of all she said somebody give me a
piece of paper give me a piece of paper
she said young boy
i have a prophecy
a spiritual prophecy
she said you are going to travel the
world
and speak to millions of people now mind
you i'm 20 years old i'm flunked out of
school in fact like a wise ass i'm
thinking to myself maybe she's got
something in that crystal ball about me
getting back into school next fall
[Music]
so when i got back to fordham that fall
i got in and i changed my major once
again
for the last time
and in the years that followed just as
that woman prophesies i have traveled
the world and i have spoken to millions
of people through my movies
[Music]
you
